More recently, he began taking over the worship director role in 2017.<br><br>In 2013 when God called him to NWCC, it was a natural fit to become a part of the worship team. Music has always been at the core of his passions and in that he finds a deep connection with God through worship & praise music.

ONN brings together service members deeply impacted by aftermath of combat, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and other service related issues. Mentors are teamed-up with our warriors, which assimilates all participants into a thriving ONN retreat.  ONN opens the door for a new \"warriors heart\" that manifests a desire and willingness to change a man's day to-day life. ONN participants discover there's a New Normal that awaits them. It's a three-day event that starts on Friday evening and ends at noon on Sunday.",
